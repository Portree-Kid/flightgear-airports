# tXml
a very small and probably the fastest xml parser in pure javascript.

This lib only provides one single method. **tXml()**

1. this code is about 230 lines, can be easily extended. 
2. this code is 0.9kb minified + gzipped.
3. this code is 5 - 10 times faster then sax/xml2js.
4. this code can running in a worker.
5. this code is parsing at average the same speed as native DOMParser + potential to be faster.
6. this code is easy to read and good for study. 
7. this code creates a domObject with minimal footprint, that is easy to traverse.
8. this code has proven in different projects, like RSS reader, openStreetmap, websites.
9. this code can even parse handwritten XML that contains various errors.
10. this code is working in client and server.
11. this code is 100% covered by unit tests.
  
so, there are good reasons to give tXml.js a try. 

## XML - features
  1. tags
  2. childTags
  3. text-nodes
  4. white-spaces
  5. attributes with single and double quotes
  6. attributes without value
  7. xmlComments (ignored)
  8. embedded CSS and Javascript
  9. HTML singleTag elements br, img, link, meta, hr
  10. doctype definitions
  11. xml namespaces
  12. sync API for a sync process
  13. getElementsById/-Class direct on the xmlString 
  14. simplify, similar to PHP's [SimpleXML](http://php.net/manual/en/book.simplexml.php)
  15. filter, similar to underscore, as a alternative to CSS selectors
  16. monomorphism for fast processing and fewer if statements (a node always has tagName:'', attributes:{} and children:[])
  
  17. streamSupport ! ! !

## Try Online
you can to some test without installing online: [tnickel.de](http://tnickel.de/2017/04/02/txml-online/)

## Installation
In browser you load it how ever you want. For example as tag: <script src="tXml.js"></script>.

In node and browseryfy, run **"npm install txml"** in your project.
and then in your script you require it by "var tXml = require('txml');

## Methods

### **tXml** *(XML-string, options)*
1. **XML string** is the XML to parse.
2. **options** is optional 
        **searchId** an ID of some object. that can be queried. Using this is incredible fast. 
        **filter** a method, to filter for interesting nodes, use it like Array.filter.
        **simplify** to simplify the object, to an easier access
        
    
    EXAMPLE 1: tXml("<user is='great'><name>Tobias</name><familyName>Nickel</familyName><profession>Software Developer</profession><location>Shanghai / China</location></user>");
```js
    // will return an object like: 
    [{
        "tagName": "user",
        "attributes": {
            "is": "great"
        },
        "children": [{
                "tagName": "name",
                "children": [ "Tobias" ]
            }, {
                "tagName": "familyName",
                "children": [ "Nickel" ]
            }, {
                "tagName": "profession",
                "children": [ "Software Developer" ]
            }, {
                "tagName": "location",
                "children": [ "Shanghai / China" ]
            }
        ]
    }]    
```   
    EXAMLPLE 2: tXml("<user is='great'><name>Tobias</name><familyName>Nickel</familyName><profession>Software Developer</profession><location>Shanghai / China</location></user>",{simplify:1});

```js
    // will return an object like: 
    {
        "user": {
            "name": "Tobias",
            "familyName": "Nickel",
            "profession": "Software Developer",
            "location": "Shanghai / China",
            "_attributes": {
                "is": "great"
            }
        }
    }
```
### **tXml.simpify** *(tXml_DOM_Object)* 
this method is used with the simplify parameter;
1. **tXml_DOM_Object** the object to simplify.

### **tXml.filter** *(tXml_DOM_Object, f)* 
this method is used with the filter parameter, it is used like Array.filter.
1. **tXml_DOM_Object** the object to filter.
2. **f** a function that returns true if you want this elements in the result set.

### **tXml.getElementById** (xml,id) 
to find an element by ID. if you are only interested for the information on, a specific node, this is easy and fast, because not the entire xml need to get parsed to a tDOM Object. returns the element not simplified, you can do with tXml.simplify()
1. **xml** the xml string to search in.
2. **id** the id of the element to find


### **tXml.getElementsByClassName** (xml,className) 
find the elements with the given class, without parsing the entire xml into a tDOM. so it is very fast and convenient. returns a list of elements. 
1. **xml** the xml string to search in.
2. **className** the className of the element to find


### **txml.parseStream** (stream, offset)
1. stream is the stream or fileName, 
2. offset requires you to set short before the first item.
        usually files begin with simething like "<!DOCTYPE osm><osm>"
        so the offset need to be before the first item starts so that 
        between that item and the offset is no "<" character.
        alternatively, pass astring, containing this preample.
return stream, triggers even "xml" to get notified when a complete node has been parsed.
is usefull for huge files, OSM-world, wikipedia-dump.

### **txml.transformStream** (offset)
2. offset optional you to set short before the first item.
        usually files begin with simething like "<!DOCTYPE osm><osm>"
        so the offset need to be before the first item starts so that 
        between that item and the offset is no "<" character.
        alternatively, pass astring, containing this preample.
return transformStream.
```js
const xmlStream = fs.createReadStream('your.xml').pipe(txml.transformStream())
for await(let element of xmlStream) {
    // your logic here ...
}
```
